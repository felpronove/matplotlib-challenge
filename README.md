Overall, the volume of a tumor in a mouse tends to be larger, the larger the mouse. Although this would make logical sense, the linear regression equation indicates that this relationship seems to be stronger than expected. For each gram the mouse weighs, the tumor volume increases by 2 mm3. 

It seems that the final tumor volume for mice treated by Capomulin or Ramicane drug regimens are significantly lower than those of mice treated by Infubinol and Ceftamin. Based on the trial, I would recommend Capomulin or Ramincane drug regimens for reducing a patient's tumor size.

One thing I would like to determine, is if a change in a mouse's weight impacts the mouse's tumor size. Based on our data, it seems the larger the mouse, the larger the tumor. By that incite, it would make sense that by losing weight, the mouse would reduce their tumor's size further. However, we would need to see the relationship between the change in a mouse's weight vs tumor size in orde to truly see the effect of weight loss/gain on the tumor volume.
